Heron of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician and engineer who provided many major contributions to
mathematics. These consisted of his methods for iteratively computing the square and cubed roots of
a number, the Heronian mean and finding the area of any triangle or quadilateral using only it's side
lengths. All of these methods originated around 60AD, being published in his work 'Metrica'.

Heron of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician and engineer who provided a number of major contributions 
to the field of mathematics through his work, Metrica (add ref).  This work was first published around
60AD, but are these methods are still useful and relevant today?  In this article firstly Heron’s method
for calculating the area of a triangle or quadrilateral are discussed before looking at his iterative
method for finding a square root and calculating the Heronian mean.  Advantages and disadvantages of these
approaches are also considered.

Heron’s Formula can be used to find the area of any triangle, regardless of if it is right-angled or not.
This allows you to find the area of scalene, isosceles and equilateral triangles using less steps in the
method and without the use of trigonometry.

Heron's Formula involves the use of the triangle's side lengths, the perimeter, and the semi-perimiter of
the triangle. The semi-perimeter of a triangle is simply the perimeter of the triangle halved, as shown by:

                 
                 <sup>(a + b + c)</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>

where a, b and c are side lenngths of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter.

The value of s is then applied to give the area of the triangle through the use of the formula:

Heron's Formula is much simpler for an equilateral triangle due to the value of s being equal to <sup>3a</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
